# JavaDelegation
This program defines four classes, A, B, C, and D where the classes C and D extend class B which in turn extends class A. The result of transformation made is four classes called A2, B2, C2, and D2 which correspond to A, B, C, and D respectively, but do not make use of class inheritance. They use Delegation using interface to remove inheritance.
